# Exercises

<!-- markdownlint-configure-file { "MD013": { "tables": false } } -->

The exercises are grouped in individual directories and can generally be
performed independently of each other. Each exercise contains at least a short
description of the tasks as well as a solution. In addition, scripts, docker
files, etc. are part of every exercise. For exercises where software (Oracle
Binaries, Patch) or code from other Git repositories is required, we refer to
it accordingly. All exercises can also be downloaded as zip files (see
[O-SEC_exercises.zip](../others/O-SEC_exercises.zip))
