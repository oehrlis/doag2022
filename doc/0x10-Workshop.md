# Workshop Exercises

## Overview of Exercises

The exercises are grouped in individual directories and can generally be
performed independently of each other.  Each exercise contains at least a short
description of the tasks (`1x??en-Exercise.md`) as well as a solution
(`1x??en-Solution.md`). In addition, scripts, docker files, etc. are part of
every exercise. For exercises where software (Oracle Binaries, Patch) or code
from other Git repositories is required, we refer to it accordingly.
